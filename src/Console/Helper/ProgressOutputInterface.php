/**
 * Interface for progress output in OPUS 4 commands like index:index, or index:extract.
 *
 * Using this interface the commands can switch between different implementations depending
 * on the desired verbosity.
 *
 * The levels are:
 * - ProgressBar as default output
 * - ProgressOutput for verbose output (-v), this is the old output after each block of documents
 * - ProgressMatrix for more verbose output (-vv), this is like PHPUnit (".....F..")
 * - ProgressDetail for maximum verbosity (-vvv), printing out detailed information after each document (or block)
 *
 * TODO ProgressMatrix not implemented yet
 * TODO ProgressDetail not implemented yet
