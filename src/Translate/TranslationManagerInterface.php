/**
 * Interface for modifying translations in OPUS 4.
 *
 * Translation keys have to be unique across modules, since all translations are loaded at runtime. If a key appears
 * in more than one module only one translation will be used, most likely the one loaded last.
 *
 * Sources of translations, like TMX files or the database, might contain duplicate keys. This needs to be handled
 * at the time of loading by logging a warning.
 *
 * TODO signal duplicate keys to administrators
 *
 * TODO convert interface for a stateless class (currently TranslationManager is not stateless)
 * TODO do we need some kind of Query and maybe a Result object?
